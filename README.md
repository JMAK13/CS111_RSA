# CS111_RSA
## CS/MATH111 EXTRA CREDIT ASSIGNMENT
For this assignment, you need to implement the RSA public-key cryptosystem in C++.  
### Input:  
a) A public key (e, n) (you need to check whether the input is valid);  
b) Choice of encryption or decryption (”e” for encryption and ”d” for decryption);

Additional input for encryption:  
c1) English text (in a text file). You can use well known quotes.  
Additional input for decryption:  

c2) Cipher text (in a text file).  
Note: in this part, you need to break RSA (follow your homework 2 (problem 2) instructions).  

### Output:  
For encryption: cipher text (written into a text file).  
For decryption: decoded message (written into a text file).  

You can reuse the character - integer encoding schema from your Homework 2 (A is 2, B is 3, ..., Z is 27,  
and blank is 28) and append it with other characters if needed.  

Submission/Demo Instructions. The project is due Sunday, February 9, 11:50pm (on Gradescope).  
The details about the submission will be posted later
